# Windows-10-Gaming-Tweaks
For minimal stutters and lower latency.
The tweaks in these folders are optional. They may impact the FPS, input latency, hit reg, and overall feel of your games. There is no best value, because everyone has different games, hardware, needs and preferences. What may be great for you may be horrible for someone else, and vice versa. After applying the tweak you restart your pc (Except for Win32 Priorities which you can test every value without any hassel).
